As we get closer to the end of the year, people usually start reflecting—or at least I do—on what they’ve accomplished over the past 12 months. I start remembering my sometimes long-forgotten New Year’s resolutions from January 1st and begin piecing together a retrospective of the year.

Was it a productive year? Did I accomplish the things I set out to do? Did unexpected events take place? How close did I stick to the original plans? I’ve been thinking about these questions as I look back on the year, now that it’s mid-December, and also about what the new year will bring. I’m already planning ahead.

The book recommendation for this week fits well with this reflective mood. It’s about trying to grasp what life is all about, figuring out your goals, and where you are in your career and personal journey. The book is called [Cabin: Off the Grid Adventures with the Clueless Craftsman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204253901-cabin) by [Patrick Hutchinson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18385691.Patrick_Hutchison).

It’s a memoir of sorts, chronicling the author’s journey from working in an office, stuck in a forest of cubicles like so many of us, yearning for something more meaningful—something that would justify waking up and working hard every day. Patrick, on a whim, went on Craigslist and found a listing for a decrepit old cabin in the middle of the Pacific Northwest woods. He bought it for $7,000, which was probably all he could muster at the time.

Disillusioned with his job and the trajectory his career had taken, Patrick felt that the cabin might be his escape from reality. It became a place where he could channel his energy during weekends, away from the monotony of work. He wasn’t a craftsman by any stretch of the imagination, but he saw learning carpentry, plumbing, and even basic electrical wiring as an opportunity to calm his mind and create a retreat where he could relax, enjoy nature, and spend time with friends.

To me, the book is about looking back on your life and seeking places to escape. It’s a feeling many of us can relate to, especially as we get older and think more about where we’ve been and where we’re headed.

Patrick slowly began upgrading the cabin, tackling projects over many years. He made improvements but deliberately avoided over-engineering or turning the cabin into a luxurious mansion. This was a place with no electricity, plumbing, or running water. He had to bring in his own water and live without modern conveniences like phone signals, internet, or television. He embraced this disconnection, finding peace in the simplicity of being surrounded by nature—the sound of rain on the roof, wind in the trees, and even the cold.

The renovation process was slow and thoughtful. Patrick learned how to install a wood stove, fix leaks, and handle everyday challenges like going to the bathroom without a sewage system. Through these experiences, he gained insights about himself and what truly matters. The financial and emotional burdens were significant, especially for someone accustomed to a certain lifestyle. Yet, the journey taught him resilience and purpose.

The book isn’t a literary classic, but it’s engaging, funny, and thought-provoking. It’s not about its literary value but the perspective it offers. As we approach the end of the year, Cabin serves as a friendly nudge for anyone thinking about what 2025 could hold. Whether it’s writing that book, making that trip, or pursuing a career change you’ve been dreaming of, this book might inspire you to take that leap.

Change is scary, and the fact that we often hesitate to act speaks to how hard it can be. [Cabin: Off the Grid Adventures with the Clueless Craftsman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204253901-cabin) by Patrick Hutchinson might just give you the push you need. It’s humorous, relatable, and full of life lessons.

I hope you enjoy it. Let me know your thoughts, and as always, keep reading.
