A few years ago, I read this incredible book that had me hooked right from the start—[*City of Thieves*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1971304.City_of_Thieves) by [David Benioff](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5541.David_Benioff), and what really spoke to me was its focus on friendship—friendship between two people who couldn’t be more different from each other. Set during the siege of Leningrad in World War II, the story revolves around two main characters: Lev Beniov, a young Russian teenager, and Kolya, a deserter from the Red Army.

These two unlikely companions are arrested by the colonel in charge of Leningrad’s defense. Lev when he's caught scavenging through the rubble for food and ends up killing a not-so-dead German paratrooper, while Kolya is arrested for desertion. Brought before the colonel, they are given a deal: bring back a dozen eggs for the colonel’s daughter's wedding cake in a week's time, and they’ll be spared.

It might sound absurd—bargaining for their lives over eggs—but that’s war for you. With food so scarce, even a dozen eggs are worth risking their lives. The rest of the novel follows their perilous journey through the countryside, a mission that turns out to be far more difficult than it seems.

Throughout *City of Thieves*, Lev and Kolya's bond grows deeper as they face violence, fear, and fleeting glimpses of humanity. It’s a powerful tale of human connection in the darkest of times, and Benioff masterfully weaves moments of humor and hope amidst the horror of war. The contrast between these two characters—one reserved, the other brimming with confidence—makes for an incredible dynamic that really resonates.

The theme of unlikely friendship reminded me of my own experience when I moved to a new town at age 12. I met a guy named Alex, who, like Kolya, came from a very different background—mid to high class, with a fancy house, cars, and a luxurious lifestyle, while my family was low to mid-middle class. At first, we didn’t get along, but those differences brought us together, and eventually, we became inseparable, going on countless adventures and sharing the typical rites of passage from childhood to teenage-hood.

The bond between Lev and Kolya is much like those deep friendships many of us form when we’re younger—the kind where you stick together through thick and thin. And that’s why this book resonated with me so strongly.

The ending? Well, I won’t spoil that—you’ll have to read it yourself! But trust me, if you’ve ever had a close friend who stuck by you through everything, you’ll appreciate *City of Thieves* even more.

So, this week’s book recommendation is [*City of Thieves*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1971304.City_of_Thieves) by [David Benioff](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5541.David_Benioff). I hope you enjoy it. Please leave your comments, don’t forget to subscribe, and until next week—keep reading!
