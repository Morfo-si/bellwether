Hey everyone, this is Og Maciel from Bellwether, and today I have a very different experience for you. I’m going to share a book that is peculiar because I’m still in the process of reading it.

The book is called [*Hamilton: The Revolution*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26200563-hamilton) and it contains all the lyrics and behind-the-scenes details of the play Hamilton, by [Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5725556.Lin_Manuel_Miranda). Even though I haven’t completed the book, I am very familiar with the content from watching the play multiple times on TV. Unfortunately, I haven’t had a chance to see it live, even though Hamilton did come to North Carolina a few years ago. Either way, I'm comfortable sharing and recommending it to you all.

Both the play and the book, are based on Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton, which came out around 2004. The book offers a deep understanding of how the play came about, sharing many trivia and background stories. Apparently, Lin-Manuel Miranda first came across Hamilton’s biography while on vacation in Mexico, and it struck a chord with him. At the time, he was exploring hip-hop as a storytelling medium for theater, and certain elements of Hamilton’s life seemed perfect for a musical told through hip-hop.

The book tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s founding fathers. What resonated with me the most is that Hamilton was an immigrant who rose from poverty. He came from a small Caribbean island to America, a place that wasn’t yet the United States. He arrived seeking a life for himself, and due to the political climate of the time—when the 13 colonies were still under British rule and unhappy with the monarchy’s tyranny—the circumstances led to the American Revolution.

Reading through the book’s lyrics and exploring the play’s historical context, we see how the revolution shaped lives and created the foundation for America. Miranda uses hip-hop and rap to tell this story, bringing the characters to life, including George Washington, the Marquis de Lafayette, Thomas Jefferson, and others, making the language accessible, rhythmic, and memorable. The music and lyrics make it easy for people to follow along and even learn history without realizing it.

I saw in a PBS documentary that Lin-Manuel Miranda first performed the opening song of Hamilton at the White House on May 12, 2009, during an event called [“Evening of Poetry, Music, and the Spoken Word.”](https://youtu.be/WNFf7nMIGnE) It was this performance that reintroduced the world to the character of Alexander Hamilton, captivating the audience, which included President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama. That was also was my first exposure to the play, and the moment that really piqued my interest in the story.

The play premiered off-Broadway at the Public Theater in Manhattan on February 17, 2015, with Miranda as Hamilton. Since then, Hamilton has received numerous awards, including 11 Tonys and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2016. Disney Plus later released a filmed version of the play in 2020, which allowed my family and me to enjoy it repeatedly. My daughters quickly connected with it, and we watched it many times. They learned so much history from the play, even before learning it in school.

This book and play resonate with me personally because I am also an immigrant who came to the U.S. with my parents in pursuit of the American dream. Hamilton captures the immigrant experience, including the struggles, loneliness, and resilience required to succeed in a new place. The lyrics emphasize the many contributions of immigrants and how this country was built on their backs and shoulders.

One of my favorite songs from the play is “My Shot.” Hamilton, a young immigrant full of ambition, seizes every opportunity, vowing not to throw away his shot. This determination and drive are deeply inspiring and resonate with me. The play and book celebrate immigrants who leave everything behind to build a life, prove their worth, and earn a sense of belonging.

Beyond the story, the book itself has been very fascinating, offering insights into the creative process behind the play. We see Miranda’s thought process and the artistic liberties he took to tell Hamilton’s story effectively. At the heart of the narrative are the complicated relationships, particularly between Hamilton and Aaron Burr, and also with Eliza Schuyler, his wife. The climactic duel between Hamilton and Burr is an iconic moment in American history, and Miranda’s portrayal brings it to life in a powerful way.

[*Hamilton: The Revolution*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26200563-hamilton) has been a fantastic read, offering both the lyrics and a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the musical. I highly recommend watching the play, reading this book, and listening to the soundtrack. If it resonates with you as much as it did with me, you might also enjoy Ron Chernow’s biography of Alexander Hamilton.

This week’s book recommendation is [*Hamilton: The Revolution*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26200563-hamilton) by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jeremy McCarter. I highly recommend it. Until next week, keep reading.
