As a younger boy in Brazil, I absolutely loved comic books! I vividly remember waiting for my turn to read a freshly bought, pages-still-crisp, fresh-off-the-magazine-stand edition of “Turma da Mônica”[^1] by the Brazilian cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa[^2]. Often, I would wait for one of my parents to come home with it so that I could be the first to enjoy it while lightly teasing my sisters as they waited their turn. Growing up, comic books were the gateway for my sisters and me to develop a love for reading. The funny, witty, and elaborate dialogues became part of our lives and the vernacular of our childhood.

When I read the brief description of <a href="https://amzn.to/3xIiTBx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Huda F. Cares"</a> and learned about the siblings and a 24-hour trip to Disney World, I immediately recalled similar car trips with my two sisters. A flood of memories of all the pains and joys that only siblings can endure and enjoy nudged me to grab a copy. The fact that the main character is a young Muslim girl trying to come to terms with her identity while also navigating the many perilous experiences of “sticking out like a sore thumb” and trying to blend in made it even more interesting to me as it brought back memories of my own childhood growing up where my leg brace and crutches made me an easy target for teasing or people staring at me pretty much all the time.

Huda Fahmy[^3] delivers a powerful message about what it is like to be different and yearning to find commonality while growing up in a world where being different can significantly impact your life. It also reminds us of the importance of family. Being the father of three young women myself, I found myself smiling and chuckling at some of the things the parents of Huda said to their daughters, consolidating in my mind once and for all that “sisters are forever!”

I not only recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/3xIiTBx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Huda F. Cares"</a> but will also highly encourage my daughters and niece to read it, starting by leaving a copy casually laying around the house or anywhere we happen to be, perhaps even in the car as we go on family trips this summer. This book is a delightful reminder of the bond between siblings and the journey of finding one’s identity in a diverse world.
