So here we are, the last week of 2024, and as promised, I have the very last book recommendation for you.

This time around, I’m going to talk about my top five reads of 2024. I have to say, it wasn’t an easy task trying to distill the 50+ books I read this year into just five. Some of these books are classics, while others are more contemporary, but most of them were new reads for me. Narrowing it down to five was a real challenge, especially between the fifth and sixth spots.

Here’s what I’ve got for you. I was going to say there’s no particular order, but truth be told, I’ve saved the best for last.

At number five, we have ["Little, Big"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62801163-little-big) by [John Crowley](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/52074.John_Crowley). This was my first time reading anything by Crowley, and the experience was fascinating. The book is dense and layered, exploring themes I wouldn’t ordinarily gravitate toward, yet I found it deeply engaging. The language is poetic, blending fantasy with the essence of a modern classic. The story revolves around Smoky Barnable, who marries the eccentric Alice Drinkwater and moves to her ancestral home, Edgewood. This house serves as a portal between the real world and the magical world. The narrative spans generations, with interconnected timelines and perspectives weaving together a family saga. The characters are compelling, the themes are rich, and the writing is exquisite. Goodreads rates it at 3.8 stars, but I’m giving it a five.

Coming in at number four is ["Skippy Dies"](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-september-10) by Paul Murray. I’ve recommended this book before, and it remains a standout read. Published in 2010, it follows Skippy Juster, a 14-year-old navigating life at a boarding school. The story is both humorous and poignant, capturing the complexities of adolescence with sharp wit and emotional depth. The ensemble cast of characters adds to the charm, with their antics, struggles, and friendships making for a relatable and entertaining read. The book brought back fond memories of my own teenage years. Goodreads gives it a 3.78 rating, but for me, it’s another five-star read.

At number three is ["The Chocolate War"](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-october-01-2024) by Robert Cormier. This book also centers on boarding school life but delves into darker themes. The story revolves around a student who defies tradition by refusing to participate in a chocolate sale, shaking up the school’s dynamics and creating political and social tensions. The book’s exploration of power, rebellion, and individuality resonated with me. It’s a gripping read with an ending that left a lasting impression.

In second place is ["Bewilderment"](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-november-26-2024) by Richard Powers. This book had such a profound impact on me that I recommended it before I even finished reading it. It’s a heartwarming yet heart-wrenching tale of an astrobiologist and his son, Robin, as they navigate life after the loss of Robin’s mother. The story touches on themes of love, family, grief, and the bond between father and son. The experimental neurofeedback treatment Robin undergoes, using his mother’s recorded brain patterns, adds a layer of scientific intrigue. It’s beautifully written and emotionally moving—a book I’ll recommend for years to come.

Finally, taking the top spot is ["The Light Eaters"](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-december-24) by Zoe Schlanger. I hinted at this last week, and it’s no surprise this book is my number one pick. Schlanger transforms a scientific topic into a captivating narrative, making it accessible and compelling. This book has fundamentally changed how I view plants, insects, and even bacteria. It’s rare for a book to have such a profound impact on my perspective, but this one did. The writing is engaging, the storytelling is masterful, and the subject matter is eye-opening. I can’t recommend it enough.

Looking back on my reading list, I notice two recurring themes: growing up and science. Many of the books explore the challenges and joys of relationships, friendships, and navigating life. Others delve into scientific topics that reignited my curiosity and reminded me of my background in biochemistry. Underpinning it all is a focus on connection—whether it’s with family, friends, or the world around us—and the importance of creating a better future for the next generation.

To everyone who followed my recommendations this year, thank you for your time and support. I look forward to sharing more books with you in 2025. Happy holidays, and as always, keep reading.
