Anyone who knows me knows I love historical fiction. So, when I had the opportunity to speak with author and former actress Diana Stevan about her series of books I could not wait to read them. This is one of those beautifully rendered stories that holds both the readers attention and their heart.

["Lilacs in the Dust Bowl"](https://amzn.to/3XB41zy) by Diana Stevan is a poignant tale of resilience amidst adversity, weaving together the struggles of immigrant life in Canada during the Great Depression with the complexities of family dynamics. Through the eyes of Lukia Mazurets, a Ukrainian peasant farmer, readers are transported to a world where survival is not just about overcoming external challenges but also navigating the internal conflicts within her family.
