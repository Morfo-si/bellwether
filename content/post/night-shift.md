Hello everyone, this is Og Maciel with another book recommendation from Bellwether. If you’ve been reading my weekly book recommendations, you might remember that back in August, I wrote about [The Nightmare Factory](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-august-20) by Thomas Ligotti. In that review, I mentioned my complicated relationship with the horror genre. I’m both attracted to and scared of horror – there’s a lure that draws me to horror stories, haunted houses, ghost stories, and the like. But at the same time, I have to admit that reading horror books, watching horror movies, or even talking about the subject can terrify me. It’s all about finding the right balance, knowing that eventually, it might catch up to me, and I’ll be left spending the night with the lights on.

This week, I’m excited to bring you a collection of short stories by one of horror’s masters—[Night Shift](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10628.Night_Shift) by [Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King), which consists of about 20 short stories offering a glimpse into King’s range in horror. Each story may start off seeming simple or straightforward, but he masterfully adds layers, weaving in elements of the supernatural, the psychological, the apocalyptic, the gruesome – you name it, he’s done it.

Reflecting on my own relationship with horror, I recall an experience from when I was around eight years old. Growing up in a small town, I shared a room with my two sisters, and occasionally, we had a cousin staying with us. One summer night, I made the mistake of turning on the TV. We only had one channel, and on that night, they were airing a horror marathon. Our small town only had one channel, and that night, they played back-to-back horror films. I remember watching Dracula in black and white, then a zombie movie, and finally a ghost story. I watched all three, transfixed, not able to pull away, until I finally fell asleep around three or four in the morning, even though I was terrified.

Dracula left the deepest impression on me. I was so scared that I started wrapping a blanket around my neck to protect myself from vampires. Even on warm nights, sweating bullets, I couldn’t sleep unless my neck was covered. For an entire year, I had this nighttime ritual, never telling anyone about it – my family probably just thought it was a weird quirk.

This collection includes unforgettable tales like *Jerusalem's Lot*, a prequel to *Salem’s Lot*, and *Graveyard Shift*, where a rat-infested basement leads to a horrific showdown. *Children of the Corn* still gives me chills whenever I see a cornfield. There's even a sci-fi twist in *I Am the Doorway*, about an astronaut returning to Earth with something terrifyingly unexpected.

Each story in *Night Shift* is a testament to King’s mastery of horror and if you’re new to his work, this is a great starting point. You might consider reading one story a night, just to dip your toes in slowly. This selection offers a taste of what he’s capable of, and I hope it resonates with you.

This week’s book recommendation is *Night Shift* by Stephen King. Until next week, keep reading.
