Hey everyone, this is Og Maciel with another book recommendation from Bellwether. This week, I’m bringing you a classic that had me hooked right from the start—[The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War) by [Robert Cormier](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10442.Robert_Cormier).

A few weeks ago, I recommended [Skippy Dies](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-september-10) by Paul Murray. After reading that book, I stumbled upon an [article](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2010/10/21/paul-murray-and-‘skippy-dies’/) on **The Paris Review** where Murray mentioned some of the books that inspired him, and one of them was [The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War). Intrigued, I headed to my local library, grabbed a copy, and couldn’t wait to dive in.

This book immediately took me back to a period in my life when I was around 10 or 11 years old. Back then, there was a TV show I used to watch called [The Space Kidettes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Space_Kidettes), and it was all about kids going on space adventures. Watching that show and having a little book club with my friends made us feel like we were part of something bigger. We even created our own group, like the boys in [The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War). I remember vividly how we organized “war exercises” with slingshots and water balloons—good times, right? Reading [The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War) brought back all those memories.

In [The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War), just like in Skippy Dies, you get a range of well-defined characters, each with their own problems, traits, and personal stories. The plot revolves around a chocolate sale organized by the interim principal at a boys’ school. This principal has high ambitions—he wants to double the amount of chocolate sold in previous years, and he also doubles the price. The story gets complicated with the involvement of a secret gang called the Vigils. No one talks about the Vigils, but they exist, playing pranks and exerting control over the students.

One student decides he won’t sell chocolates, and this act of rebellion sends shockwaves through the school. You’ll have to read the book to uncover why this kid refuses to comply, but trust me, it’s worth it. The story builds up to an intense final confrontation that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

What I loved most about [The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War) is how fast-paced and gripping it is. I couldn’t put it down—I finished it in about a day and a half. It’s the perfect mix of nostalgia and tension, capturing that time in life when peer pressure, authority, and rebellion collide.

So, if you’re looking for something that’s as engaging as [Skippy Dies](https://bellwetherweekly.substack.com/p/book-recommendation-for-september-10) or if you just want a thought-provoking read, I highly recommend [The Chocolate War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17162.The_Chocolate_War) by [Robert Cormier](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10442.Robert_Cormier). This book will take you back to those moments of standing up for what you believe in, even when it feels like the whole world is against you.

As always, let me know what you think of these recommendations! I love hearing your feedback. Until next week, keep reading.
