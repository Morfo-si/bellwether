<a href="https://amzn.to/3RiPkNp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">“The Obstacle is the Way” was the book that introduced me to Stoicism and perhaps is responsible for bringing this ancient philosophy to a new generation. I have recommended it multiple times and referred to it whenever I am giving friends and family advice about their personal or work-related challenges, as well as for my own day-to-day challenges. Holiday’s ability to distill Stoic principles into practical advice has been invaluable in helping me and those around me navigate obstacles with a more positive and resilient outlook.

> "We forget: In life, it doesn’t matter what happens to you or where you came from. It matters what you do with what happens and what you’ve been given."

I highly recommend “The Obstacle is the Way” to anyone looking for a transformative read that offers timeless wisdom for overcoming life’s hurdles. This book and the philosophy of Stoicism helped me immensely at work when I felt that my career progression and future at the company were limited by a metaphorical boulder that would not budge. By applying Stoic principles, I was able to view this obstacle as an opportunity, leveraging it to build the team I had always dreamed of. Whether you’re dealing with personal setbacks, professional challenges, or simply seeking a more resilient mindset, this book provides powerful tools to help you turn adversity into advantage. It’s a must-read for anyone interested in self-improvement and personal growth.
