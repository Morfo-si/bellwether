Hey everyone, this week, I’m bringing you something completely different from my previous suggestions, and as always, I’ve got to start with a little story.

When I was in my early teens, I was obsessed with reading comic books—specifically *Conan the Barbarian*. I don't even remember who the publisher was, it was that long ago. But every time a new edition hit the shelves, I’d rush to the local magazine shop to grab a copy. I didn’t miss a single issue. I was also lucky enough to have a friend who shared my passion for *Conan*, and we’d spend hours talking about each adventure.

What really drew me into those comics was the incredible language used by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66700.Robert_E_Howard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robert E. Howard</a>, the creator of *Conan*. Howard was an American author—he was born in Texas. He had this amazing ability to combine the idea of a savage hero, someone like Conan who solved most problems with brute strength, with mystical and unexpected situations. One minute Conan would be fighting off bandits, and the next he’d be facing supernatural horrors or battling wizards. Howard’s vocabulary was advanced, but still accessible, and he painted vivid imagery that was impossible to forget.

But this week’s recommendation isn’t about *Conan the Barbarian*—it’s about another hero that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66700.Robert_E_Howard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robert E. Howard</a> created before Conan, and his name is Solomon Kane. The book I’m recommending is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363711.The_Savage_Tales_of_Solomon_Kane" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane"</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66700.Robert_E_Howard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robert E. Howard</a>. If you’re a fan of classic sword-and-sorcery adventures, this is an absolute must-read.

This collection introduces Solomon Kane, a relentless Puritan warrior with an unshakable moral code and a fierce sense of justice. Much like Conan, Solomon Kane faces off against both human and supernatural foes, battling evil across Europe and Africa. What makes Kane such a compelling character isn’t just his combat prowess, but his internal struggle. As a Puritan, he’s bound by a strict morality, but he’s constantly drawn into terrifying mystical confrontations that challenge his beliefs.

Howard’s writing really shines here, effortlessly blending swashbuckling action with gothic horror. His world-building is fantastic, creating a dark and brutal landscape where danger lurks at every turn. Each story in this collection plunges you into a new, haunting adventure, filled with gripping battles and chilling encounters with the unknown.

If you’re a fan of dark fantasy, old-school adventure, or historical fiction with a supernatural twist, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363711.The_Savage_Tales_of_Solomon_Kane" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane"</a> will take you on an unforgettable journey into a shadowy world. Expect intense fights, terrifying creatures, and a hero who won’t back down, no matter the odds. I highly recommend this book for lovers of pulp fiction and anyone looking to explore the roots of the fantasy genre.

So once again, this week’s recommendation is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/363711.The_Savage_Tales_of_Solomon_Kane" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane"</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66700.Robert_E_Howard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robert E. Howard</a>. I hope you’re enjoying these book recommendations! Please leave a comment or give feedback—I’d love to hear if these episodes are hitting the mark.
