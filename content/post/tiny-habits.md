Hey everyone, this is Og Maciel with another book recommendation from Bellwether. Your weekly book recommendation is delivered every Tuesday—no miss, no fail!

This week, I’m excited to recommend a book that falls into the self-help category, but don’t roll your eyes just yet! I know the term "self-help" can make people cringe, but trust me, this book is different. By the time you finish hearing what I have to say—and if you give it a chance—I think you’ll agree it’s worth your time.

The book I’m talking about is [*Tiny Habits*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44564596-tiny-habits) by [B.J. Fogg](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5141199.B_J_Fogg). I came across it through another book or article on self-improvement, and as someone who believes in continuous personal growth, I had to check it out. Now, I’m not always about optimizing every little thing in my life, but I love finding positive, practical ways to make small changes that stick.

The core idea of *Tiny Habits* is simple but powerful: most people approach creating new habits the wrong way. Whether it’s dieting, learning something new, or reading more, we often set these big, daunting goals that can feel overwhelming. I've done it too—deciding, “That’s it, no more junk food starting tomorrow!” or “I’ll read a book a week from now on!” But as we all know, those grand plans usually fizzle out.

The beauty of *Tiny Habits* is that it focuses on starting small—so small that you can’t fail. B.J. Fogg provides fantastic examples, like how if brushing your teeth every day is a struggle, instead of trying to overhaul your routine, just start by brushing one tooth. It sounds silly, but it’s like cracking the door open. It’s manageable and builds confidence.

Throughout the book, Fogg talks about creating routines built around tiny, easy-to-do actions. These steps are so small that they become automatic. The momentum you build from those small actions gives you the confidence and motivation to keep going. He even introduces the formula *B = MAP* (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt), a simple but powerful framework to understand how behaviors form and how to tweak them when needed.

Let me share a personal story that connects perfectly with this concept. I’ve used crutches since I was seven, and when my wife and I had our first daughter, I realized my crutches were a potential hazard for her as she started crawling and walking. The screws on my crutches stuck out, and I was terrified she’d hurt herself. So, I made a tiny adjustment—every time I moved around the house, I made sure the screws were turned away from her. This tiny habit became second nature, and even though my daughter is now 23, I still do it today.

The motivation to protect her was strong, the ability to make the adjustment was easy, and the prompt—her being nearby—was right in front of me. This is exactly what Fogg talks about. When you have the right combination of motivation, ability, and prompt, building habits becomes so much easier.

I’ve also applied these principles to develop a strong reading habit. Today, I average about 50 books a year, but 15 years ago, reading was a struggle. I’d get easily distracted, especially during my early career as a software engineer. I knew I wanted to be someone who read regularly, but my motivation wasn’t strong, and I lacked a good prompt. Eventually, I started using my lunch breaks to read. I began with just 10 minutes of reading in a quiet spot, and over time, it became second nature.

The book highlights three key principles: first, tie your new habit to an existing routine; second, make the habit so tiny it’s nearly impossible to fail; and third, celebrate your small victories. Even celebrating tiny wins, like reading just one page, can help build momentum and reinforce the habit.

If you’re looking for a practical, no-pressure way to build better habits, I highly recommend [*Tiny Habits*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44564596-tiny-habits) by [B.J. Fogg](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5141199.B_J_Fogg). Whether you’re trying to improve your health, build a new skill, or live a more balanced life, this book offers actionable, easy-to-implement advice.

Thank you to everyone who continues to support me by reading these book recommendations and leaving your likes and feedback. Until next week, keep reading!
